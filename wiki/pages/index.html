            <p>To the artists -</p>

            <p>Asylum Ventures is a new venture firm dedicated to the creative act of building companies. We raised $55 million to invest $1-2 million in early-stage founders practicing the art of making startups.</p>

            <article>
                <p>In 2007, I was working as a junior trader at Lehman Brothers. I hated it - the dehumanizing culture, lack of creativity, and singular focus on transactions and money left me feeling uninspired and lost. I didn't know it then, but Lehman's bankruptcy in '08 was a gift, and I left in search of a calling.</p>

                <p>I spent a few years meandering - writing, working odd jobs, grad school in Hong Kong - ultimately ending up back in NYC in 2009, having stumbled upon a young, passionate group of misfits that folks were calling "founders." These founders felt more like artists than assets, more obsessives than executives. They were avant garde, they were building the things they wanted to see in the world, and to my surprise, people called venture capitalists gave them money to pursue their dreams.</p>
